# awesome-polkadot

An opinionated list of awesome resources in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Goal

The problem I found with other awesome lists is that there are so many links and resources, that quality is lost to the noise, and approachability becomes overwhelming.

Unlike other awesome lists, this is NOT meant to be a comprehensive list for all options available in the Polkadot ecosystem. Instead, this will be a very opinionated and unapologetic list of resources which I find useful and that I use myself.

You can feel confident that if you use these same resources, they will work and provide a great experience.

If you find any problems with any of the resources in this list, please [open an issue](https://github.com/shawntabrizi/awesome-polkadot/issues).

## Education

Here are my favorite resources to get you caught up with all things Polkadot.

Developer educational resources can be found in the [Developer](#developer) section below.

### The Basics

If you are just getting started in the Polkadot ecosystem, the following resources will be super useful to begin your journey to learn about and understand Polkadot.

- [The Polkadot Homepage](https://polkadot.com/)

	This is the official homepage for the Polkadot Network. Follow the story of Polkadot told by this site and learn the basics.

- [The Decisions of Polkadot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQckxpMUBo8)

	This is a presentation that I gave describing the philosphies, goals, and decisions of developing the Polkadot Network. Obviously there is little bit of bias here, but I think this is a great resource, not to understand what Polkadot is today, but what Polkadot is in general.

### More Advance Resources

Now that you have covered the basics of Polkadot, it's time to dive a deeper.
