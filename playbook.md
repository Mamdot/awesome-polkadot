# The Polkadot Playbook

The minimum set of information you need to be able to explain Polkadot to others.

## What is Polkadot?

- Polkadot is a scaling solution for Web3 applications.
- Polkadot scales through data and execution sharding, allowing for parallelized throughput.
- Polkadot provides shared security and interoperability to services build on it.
- Polkadot creates abundant, flexible, and high quality blockspace.
- Polkadot uses a novel "cynical" rollup to provide fast finality while using minimal resources.

## Why choose Polkadot?

- On average, blocks are finalized in under 30 seconds.
	- Compare that to optimisic rollups which may take up to a week!
- Executing and scaling on standard "gaming" hardware.
	- Compared to expensive and centralized machines needed for vertical scaling or ZK.
- 50+ active roll-ups building
- Billions of dollars of economic security provided to itself and applications running on it.

## What can you do on Polkadot?

- Build applications which execute automatically (without initial user input).
- Build applications with full control over block construction and transaction execution.
- Build applications which dynamically scale up and down execution cores.
- Build applications which execute at sub-second
- Build applications where end-users pay no transaction fees.

## Where is Polkadot leading?

- Among the highest Nakamoto coefficients in the blockchain ecosystem. [[Source][1]]
- 2nd largest developer community
