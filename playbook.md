# The Polkadot Playbook

The minimum set of information you need to be able to explain Polkadot to others.

## What is Polkadot?

- Polkadot is a scaling solution for Web3[^1] applications and services.
- Polkadot scales through data and execution sharding, allowing for parallelized throughput.[^2]
- Polkadot provides shared security and interoperability to services build on it.[^3]
- Polkadot creates abundant, flexible, and high quality blockspace.[^4]
- Polkadot uses a novel "cynical" rollup to provide fast finality while using minimal resources.[^5]

## What unique things can you do on Polkadot?

- Build applications which execute automatically (without initial user input).
- Build applications with full control over block construction and transaction execution.
- Build applications which dynamically scale up and down execution cores.
- Build applications which execute at sub-second speeds.[^21]
- Build applications where end-users pay no transaction fees.

## Why choose Polkadot?

- Billions of dollars of economic security provided to itself and applications running on it.
- Fast finalization times, on average under 30 seconds.
	- Compare that to optimistic rollups which may take up to a week!
	- Block production is separated from finality, reducing network stalls.[^31]
- Executing and scaling on standard "gaming" hardware.
	- Compared to expensive and centralized machines needed for vertical scaling or ZK provers.
- 50+ active roll-ups building [^32]
	- Many projects outside of Polkadot also use the Polkadot SDK.[^33]
- Secure cross-chain interoperability with a native bridging protocol.
- Trustless bridges to other blockchain ecosystems.[^33]

## Where is Polkadot leading?

- Among the highest Nakamoto coefficients in the blockchain ecosystem.[^41]
- 2nd largest developer community after Ethereum.[^42]
- Blazing fast execution speeds compared to other blockchain VMs.[^43]
- One of the largest functioning DAOs, managing tens of millions of dollars in assets.[^44]
