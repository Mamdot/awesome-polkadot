# The Polkadot Playbook

The minimum set of information you need to be able to explain Polkadot to others.

## What is Polkadot?

- Polkadot is a scaling solution for Web3[^1] applications and services.
- Polkadot scales through data and execution sharding, allowing for parallelized throughput.[^2]
- Polkadot provides shared security and interoperability to services build on it.[^3]
- Polkadot creates abundant, flexible, and high quality blockspace.[^4]
- Polkadot uses a novel "cynical" rollup to provide fast finality while using minimal resources.[^5]

## What unique things can you do on Polkadot?

- Build applications which execute automatically (without initial user input).
- Build applications with full control over block construction and transaction execution.[^20]
- Build applications which dynamically scale up and down execution cores.
- Build applications which execute at sub-second speeds.[^21]
- Build applications that can permissionlessly upgrade and evolve over time.[^22]

## Why choose Polkadot?

- Billions of dollars of economic security provided to itself and applications running on it.
- Fast finalization times, on average under 30 seconds.[^31]
- Executing and scaling on standard "gaming" hardware.[^32]
- Polkadot SDK is the most robust and flexible blockchain framework.[^34]
- Secure cross-chain interoperability through trustless bridging protocols.[^35]

## Where is Polkadot leading?

- 50+ active roll-ups live on Polkadot.[^40]
- Among the highest Nakamoto coefficients in the blockchain ecosystem.[^41]
- 2nd largest developer community after Ethereum.[^42]
- Blazing fast execution speeds compared to other blockchain VMs.[^43]
- One of the largest functioning DAOs, managing the functionality of the network and tens of millions of dollars in assets for development.[^44]

[^34]:
	- Polkadot and Kusama are built with the Polkadot SDK.
	- All 50+ live parachains, and many more in development, all use Polkadot SDK.
	- Many projects outside of Polkadot also use the Polkadot SDK.
